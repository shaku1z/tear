# TEAR — Source-of-Truth Parity Restoration Plan

**Oracle commit:** `ee5e93141d67cc02505b2227b3be0b10d1819e1c` ("fix(weapons): align throw range and handling") — the last pre-redesign monolith (`js/*.js`). Everything in this plan is measured against that commit's *behavior*, not just its text.

**Problem statement:** the architectural redesign (`0829094` + `3318931`, 571 files, js/ monolith → modular TS `src/`) introduced "lazy" divergences. Four restore commits already re-matched some code textually (`937a09c`…`b98497b`), yet the blade/cursor/mouse still doesn't feel like the source, and UI screens like the draft differ. That tells us the remaining bugs are **systemic** (frame order, state ownership, dt model, adapter plumbing) rather than line-level — so this plan attacks parity as a *measurable property*, not a vibe.

---

## Phase 0 — Build the Parity Oracle (foundation for everything else)

You can't restore a feel you can't measure. Before touching gameplay code:

1. **Twin-serve harness.** `git worktree add ../Tear-oracle ee5e931` and serve it (it's plain JS, `serve.py` works). Run oracle and redesign side by side in two browser tabs for direct A/B feel checks.
2. **Input-trace replayer.** A small dev harness that records a raw event stream (mousemove deltas, buttons, keys, timestamps) once, then injects the identical stream into BOTH builds. Dump per-frame `{aimX, aimY, reticle, blade tip, player x/y/vx/vy, state}` to JSON.
3. **Golden-trace differ.** A script (`scripts/parity-diff.mjs`) that compares the two dumps and reports first-divergence frame + field. This turns "feels off" into "frame 214: aimX diverges by 31px because delta was consumed twice."
4. **Cursor-state probe.** Log every pointer-lock request/exit, `Input.mode` change, and CSS cursor change with the game state at that moment, in both builds, for the same scripted session (menu → play → draft → pause → menu).

Deliverable: `tests/parity/` harness + first divergence report. This is the microscope every later phase uses.

## Phase 1 — Blade / Cursor / Mouse: restore the input contract end-to-end

Known structural differences already spotted (all in the new build):

- **Double-capture path:** `live-game-runtime.ts:384` (`sampleAim: () => blade.captureDeviceAim(...)`) lets the replay recorder consume pointer-lock deltas *before* the simulation; `blade-core.ts` then calls `captureDeviceAim` again inside `_updateAim`. The second call sees a zeroed delta — harmless only if call *order and hand position* exactly match the oracle's single mid-update read. In the oracle, `_updateAim` was the one and only sampler. Audit exactly when `sampleAim` fires relative to player physics; the hand anchor it uses (`handPos(player)` pre-step vs post-step) shifts the aim vector by a frame of player movement every frame — a classic "mushy aim" source.
- **`aimOverridePoint()` lazily latches** (`aimOverride ??= {…}`, blade-core.ts:122) — the oracle never latched; overrides were written explicitly per frame by attract/mirror. Any stray call on the *player's* blade permanently hijacks aim until `clearOverrides` runs. Verify no live-play path (mirror echo, replay adapters, debug snapshot) touches the player blade's `aimOverridePoint`.
- **Pointer-lock lifecycle:** oracle rules — `Input.allowLock = (state === "playing")` set every frame (game.js:3581), `exitPointerLock()` at every transition out of play (draft open, pause, continue, replay, pgmenu…), and `Input.consumeDelta()` flushed on re-lock (game.js:6577) so freed-cursor motion never kicks the reticle. Verify each of those exits/flushes has a 1:1 equivalent in the state-machine adapters; the redesign scattered them across `live-debug-harness`, `reward-runtime`, and screen adapters — a missed one = reticle jump or stuck-locked cursor.
- **Cursor presentation:** `cursor-contract.ts` shows the **native** cursor during unlocked "playing" — the oracle drew the UI arrow on every non-playing screen (game.js:3868) and showed *nothing extra* in playing; check `data-imode` body attribute parity too (game.js:468). Reproduce the oracle's exact policy table: {state × mode × locked} → cursor.
- **Frame/dt model:** oracle ran variable-dt rAF; the redesign has `runtime-frame-driver` / `runtime-frame-coordinator` (possible fixed-step). Blade whip feel (tip speed → glow → hit checks in `_recomputeTip`, spring constants, `lerp(…, k*dt)`) was tuned for the oracle's dt regime. Confirm the sim step matches; if fixed-step was introduced, either revert to source timing or prove trace-parity through the differ.
- **Sensitivity & tether:** diff `CONFIG.blade` (aimSensitivity, aimRadius, minTether, spring constants) field-by-field between `js/config.js@ee5e931` and `src/config/*`; also `Input.tetherHeld` derivation (lmb + padTether channels).

Exit criteria: input-trace differ shows zero divergence over a 60s recorded session covering held swings, capture/release, throws, tether-tighten, pause/draft round-trips; side-by-side A/B feels identical.

## Phase 2 — Drafts UI (and sibling reward screens) back to source

The oracle's draft flow (game.js): `buildDraft()` (≥2 Specials guaranteed per 10-wave stage, expandedDraft → 4 cards), `state = "draft"` + `exitPointerLock()`, `renderDraft()` with card layout, keyboard `focus`, `listScroll` reset so cards are never culled, `uiZoom` for small touch screens, reroll + reserve + tierup as sibling states.

1. **Pixel parity pass:** screenshot oracle draft/reserve/tierup at 1920×1080 and mobile logical size; diff against the new `src/presentation/screens` renderers (card geometry, typography, rarity colors, special badges, reroll button, hover/focus halo, entrance animation timing).
2. **Behavior parity:** draft guarantee math (`specialsOffered`, `specialBlock`, `draftsLeft` window), reroll count sourcing, reserve-pick flow, evolve-priority path ("nothing to evolve → normal draft", game.js:2226), wave-clear beat delay before the draft opens (game.js:2173), zoom + scroll reset rules.
3. **Input parity on the screen itself:** mouse hover vs keyboard focus vs pad focus; click-source tagging so touch taps aren't misread; cursor arrow drawn over the draft (non-playing screen rule from Phase 1).
4. Extend the same audit to the screens the draft shares chrome with: **pause, gameover, win, continue, confirmquit** — the redesign rebuilt them from the same screen-registry machinery, so any systemic styling drift will show there too.

## Phase 3 — Full-surface UI regression sweep (find the *other* lazy changes)

A systematic hunt rather than waiting for you to notice each one:

1. **Screen census:** enumerate every oracle state (`menu, setup, playing, paused, draft, reserve, tierup, settings, continue, gameover, win, pgmenu, pglab, rename, replay, codex/profile/leaderboard hubs, ledger sub-screens`) and capture oracle screenshots as the reference set.
2. Walk the same census in the redesign (browser journey tests already exist in `tests/` — reuse them) and image-diff. Triage divergences into: intentional (none expected — source of truth wins), lazy simplification (fix), or missing feature (restore).
3. Special attention to systems the memories flag as painstakingly tuned: attract-mode live background on all tabs, hero PLAY menu, Ledger's 7 sub-screens, mobile Pocket overlay zoom + touch density, controller focus/scroll model, HUD (style meter, storm bank, boss ritual banners).
4. **UI.t token audit:** diff `js/ui.js` + `js/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` tokens against `src/presentation/ui-tokens.ts` — one wrong token value silently reskins dozens of screens.

## Phase 4 — Player & enemy behavior parity

The oracle's `enemy.js` (4225 lines), `player.js`, `mirror.js`, `projectile.js`, `voidgen.js` were shredded into `src/gameplay/**`. Beyond feel, the risks are dt-sensitivity and lost side effects:

1. **Physics constants + integrators:** diff player movement (accel, friction, jump, dash, updraft/slam empowerment windows, coyote/buffer timing) and confirm integration order (velocity-then-position vs position-then-velocity changes feel at identical constants).
2. **Enemy AI conformance:** for each enemy kind + the four Pantheon bosses + THE MIRROR, replay a scripted player trace in both builds and diff enemy positions/HP/phase timings. The wave-clear planner, spawn scheduler, and affix application already have unit tests — add *oracle-conformance* fixtures generated from the old build.
3. **Combat resolution:** tip-speed hit gating (`minHitSpeed`), pierce sets, parry windows, launch/spike/superslam empowerment branches, tether yank forces (incl. boss resistance 0.18/0.12 counter-pull), throw range/recall state safety (the oracle commit itself was a throw-handling fix — verify it survived the port).
4. **Weapons overhaul (WA1)** sits on top: confirm the five-weapon ability layer still matches its own conformance tests *after* any physics/dt corrections, since retuning dt can silently rebalance it.

## Phase 5 — Lock it in

1. Convert every trace/screenshot comparison that found a bug into a permanent test: golden input-replay checksums for blade/player, snapshot tests for screens, conformance fixtures for enemies.
2. `docs/PARITY.md`: the contract table (cursor policy, pointer-lock lifecycle, frame model, draft guarantees) so future refactors have a spec instead of re-deriving from the monolith.
3. Commit per phase, push after each commit (project rule). Suggested branch: continue on `codex/architectural-redesign`.

## Confirmed parity repairs

- **Leaderboard Ghost playback + replay theatre (2026-07-22):** the ee5e931 packager returns `Object.assign(baseRecording, summary)` (`js/ghost.js@ee5e931:92-99`), so its terminal summary intentionally overwrites the timed `loadout` track with final-build entries shaped `{ id, tier, n }`. The redesigned validator only accepted timed `{ t, id, tier, w }` entries and rejected established public leaderboard recordings after a successful cloud download. The bounded migration now recognizes both exact shapes, preserves final stack counts, keeps malformed hybrids rejected, and records future final summaries beside the canonical timed track. Linked-replay loading now reports status on the launching leaderboard rather than the hidden Profile channel. The Leaderboards podium/table, shared 96px replay cards, understated hub tabs, and dark cinematic replay transport/info panel are restored from `js/game.js@ee5e931:5557-5898`; a real Firebase `lb_campaign_normal_*` run was downloaded and played in the built artifact with no page errors.
- **Boss arrival release (2026-07-22):** the oracle mutates the live boss's `introT` to zero before discarding `bossIntro` (`js/game.js@ee5e931:3593-3594`). The redesigned frame boundary advanced a detached snapshot, discarded it on the terminal frame, and stranded the real actor at a small positive `introT`. That permanently activated every boss's movement and collision-protection gate. The adapter now explicitly commits the terminal mutation, with a detached-snapshot unit regression and a five-boss browser journey that proves intro release, post-intro AI movement, pointer capture, and real held-blade damage.
- **Exclusive Tear cursor ownership (2026-07-22, user-blessed oracle divergence):** the oracle draws its ink arrow on every non-playing screen (`js/game.js@ee5e931:3868`) but also exposes the native cursor for mouse input (`index.html@ee5e931:80`), producing two overlapping cursor surfaces. The game shell now keeps the hardware cursor hidden across canvas and DOM controls while retaining the authored ink arrow and gameplay blade reticle. The browser input matrix protects mouse, keyboard, pointer-lock, fullscreen-control, and ultrawide states.

## Sequencing & effort

Phase 0 first and non-negotiable (~the microscope). Then 1 → 2 (the two named complaints), then 3 ∥ 4 (independent), then 5. Each phase ends with a side-by-side A/B session as the human acceptance test.
